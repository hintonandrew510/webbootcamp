                            The University was the first community university in the nation. In 1980, Andrew Hinton , a Raleigh Programmer and educator founded 
                            the Computing and Coding program and declared its purpose to be the development in young men and women of the character and sound 
                            academic training requisite for real service to the nation.  In 1981, he and fellow trustees laid the cornerstone of the 
                            first building, C. Students arrived in 2018, and The University became the only community university to award 
                            degrees in the 20th century.
